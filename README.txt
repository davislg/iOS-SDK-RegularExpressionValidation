This Xcode project is a demonstration for validation using Regular Expressions in Objective-C and iOS SDK. The first version of this project validates a phone number TextField using NSPredicate and Regular Expressions. You can virtually validate anything you want as long as it's possible with the Regex engine.

I will update this project later for an additional method of validation using Regular Expressions with NSRegularExpression. Note that NSRegularExpression was only introduced in versions of iOS 4 and later.
